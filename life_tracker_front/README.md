### Core Features

- [ ] **The Nav Bar:** Implement customized views for users who are logged in vs not logged in.

  - [x] If no user is logged in, it should display **Login** and **Register** buttons
  - [x] Display a logo on the far left side, and contain links to the individual detailed activity page. 
- [x] **The Landing Page:** Display a large hero image and a brief blurb on what this application is about
- [x] **Login Page:** A form that allows users to login with email and password.
- [x] **Registration Page:** A form that allows the user to sign up with their email, password, username, first name, and last name.
- [ ] When a user first authenticates, they should be redirected to an authenticated view (i.e the detailed activity page). When they sign out, all frontend data should be reset.
- [ ] Users have access to an overview Activity page that show one summary statistic about each of the 3 types of activity tracked.
- [ ] The API should have a `security` middleware that only allows authenticated users to access resources and only allows users to access resources about themselves. 
- [x] Users should have the ability to track at least **1** types of activities (i.e Nutrition, Exercise, Sleep, etc.). Each activity should be tracked on separate pages.
- [ ] Deployed website with Heroku & Surge. 

**Detailed Activity Page:**
- [x] The detailed activity page should display a feed of all previous tracked activities.
- [ ] The detailed activity should contain a form to contain relevant information. (i.e if tracking nutrition this form allows the user to capture calories, timestamp, image, category, etc.) 
- [ ] The activity tracked should be given a unique id for easy lookup.
  `TODO://` Add link to table schema in the link code below. Your file should end in `.sql` and show your schema for the detailed activities table. (üö´ Remove this paragraph after adding schema link)
  * [Table Schema](üìùADD LINK TO TABLE SCHEMA.sql HERE!) 

### Stretch Features

Implement any of the following features to improve the application:
- [ ] Each model (`nutrition`, `exercise`, and `sleep`) should also implement a `fetchById` method that queries the database for a record by its id and only serves it to users who own that resource. Create a new dynamic route on the frontend that displays detail about a single record. For instance, `nutrition/detail/:id` should show a page with all the information about a single nutrition item.
- [ ] Provide a dropdown that allows users to filter activity based on a certain attribute of any activity item.
- [ ] Calculate aggregate statistics based on time periods - such as daily, weekly, monthly aggregates.
- [ ] Create a page that shows all other users that use the life tracker application and allow users to follow each other.
